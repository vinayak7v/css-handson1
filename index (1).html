    <ol class="list">

        <li>CSS is Stand for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS Discribe how HTML element are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="line">Css is not Neccesary</span> <span class="line2">Css saves a lots of Work </span>.It can control the layout of multiple Web pages all at onces</li>
        <br>
        <li  class="Underline"><span class="line4">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="heading2">CSS can be added in HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul class="list2">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external css file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external CSS file. However,<span class="line3">
            in this <br> tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</span> because this is easier to demostrate, 
            and easier for you to  it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p class="list1">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a styles to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.
        ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="list1">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.
        Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="list1">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.
        Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
